2. **Positioning Elements:** Positioning the character's legs and arms alternately for the walking animation.
3. **Rhythm and Pace:** Adjusting the rhythm and pace of the animation.
4. **Text Reveal:** Defining the moment when the character disappears to reveal text.

## Solutions Applied

1. **Animating Character:** Used JavaScript to create an animated Lego character that walks by alternately moving its legs and arms, showcasing the ability to work with animations and user interactions.
2. **Positioning Elements:** Placed the legs and arms in opposite positions to simulate walking, demonstrating attention to detail and understanding of animation principles.
3. **Rhythm and Pace:** Adjusted the rhythm and pace of the character's movement, reflecting skills in fine-tuning animations for a desired effect.
4. **Text Reveal:** Synchronized the character's disappearance with the text reveal, showing an effective storytelling technique.
